# ELSS-correlation-study
The goal of this notebook is to find commonality between ELSS mutual funds so that you can increase diversification when choosing more than one ELSS fund to invest in.

The data is scraped in real-time from www.moneycontrol.com.


We take a few assumptions (though the code is made s.t. the assumptions can reveresed with minimum changes):

1. You are looking at only the category of the stock holdings and not the stock itself.
2. Default first choice is Quant Mutual fund due to its high returns compared to its peers.


Conclusion: Canara robero elss fund had the lowest commality (~41%) and thus is the best choice for diversification.
